# Template Worker using Itty Router

## HTTP Imports

No need to use `npm` or have a `package.json` - just import from any URL:

```javascript
import { Router } from 'https://pkg.do/itty-router'
import { withParams, json } from 'https://pkg.do/itty-router-extras'

const router = Router()

router.get('/', ({url}) => json({ url, 'Deploy in Seconds üöÄ': 'https://github.com/drivly/itty-router-template/generate' }))
router.get('/:resource?/:id?', withParams, ({url, resource, id}) => json({ url, resource, id}))

export default {
  fetch: router.handle
}
```

## Instant Deployment

Uses [drivly/deploy-worker](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-worker) GitHub Action for 5-10 second deployment times!

```yaml
name: Deploy
on: push
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: drivly/deploy-worker@beta-1
```

## Commit-specific URLs

And every commit gets auto-deployed instantly with it's own URL: <https://c329df8.workers.do/>

## Friendly Subdomains

If you specify a name in the Actions config, you can get a custom subdomain: <https://itty.workers.do>

```yaml
name: Deploy
on: push
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: drivly/deploy-worker@beta-1
        with:
          name: 'itty'
```

## Custom Domains

To use a custom domain, just create a CNAME record to `workers.do` and add a domain variable to the config:

```yaml
name: Deploy
on: push
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: drivly/deploy-worker@beta-1
        with:
          name: 'itty'
          domain: 'itty.one'
```

### Coming Soon - Wildcard Custom Domain support for Commit Hash Deploys:

This will requiring adding TXT files to your DNS for verifation, unlike specific non-wildcard domains that can be validated automatically via HTTP.
